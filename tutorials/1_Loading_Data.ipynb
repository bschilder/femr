    "# Loading Data into FEMR\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently to use FEMR, you need to load data using some command-line tools which you get from `pip install femr`. This is because FEMR uses a specific class called `PatientDatabase` which relies on re-organizing the loaded data into an indexed format on disk (this is to preemptively avoid memory issues if running on large datasets, e.g. >50gb / something that doesn't fit into RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will go through how to get a `PatientDatabase` so you can use the rest of FEMR."

    "### Pre-requisite: Organize data into the FEMR \"Simple\" Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The FEMR \"simple\" format is a CSV with at least 4 coulmns: `patient_id`, `start`, `code`, `value`\n",
    "\n",
    "All fields are required except for `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `patient_id` must be a 64 bit unsigned integer\n",
    " - `start` is an ISO 8601 timestamp string, ideally when the event is initially recorded in the database\n",
    " - `code` is a string that must consist of two parts: 1) a vocabulary signfier and 2) the code itself, seperated by a \"/\" character. For example ICD10CM/E11.4 would indicate the ICD10 code E11.4.\n",
    " - `value` can either be a numeric value, string, or omitted\n",
    "\n",
    "A mock example is provided below:\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "patient_id,start,code,value\n",
    "3,1970-01-07,Birth/Birth,\n",
    "3,1990-01-07,Gender/Gender,Female\n",
